## :dart: About ##

The Focus Time application is a simple tool for managing your time and increasing your productivity. Using customized intervals of 5 minutes, the application helps you to work in focused sessions and keep track of your progress. It presents only three states: completed, in progress, and suspended.

The application aims to solve the problem of lack of focus and productivity during work sessions. By using a simple and customizable timer, it encourages users to work in focused sessions and take breaks to recharge their energy.

This project was created to practice fundamental concepts of React Hooks like useContext, useState, useEffect, useForm, useReducer, and Date Formatting. The main idea is to provide a simple and effective tool while improving React skills and learning how to use Hooks to manage state and form data.
